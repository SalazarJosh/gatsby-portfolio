Today, as I write this, I’m exploring how to write inclusive alt text. My long journey with digital accessibility and interest in inclusive design has, somehow, brought me here. Tomorrow I’ll be exploring something else. Next week, something else.

I’m a generalist by craft but that doesn’t keep me from specialization. I’ve presented on several topics ranging from digital accessibility to UX design to front-end web development both in the classroom and on a stage. Curiosity and exploration is what keeps me going in this field. I’m always interested in speaking opportunities so feel free to reach out. 

I’m also interested in chatting about all things web. Please say hi and let's have a chat about typography, a big project you’re working on, or a cool new JavaScript library you’re playing with. Or you can help me understand why spaces are better than tabs (seriously, why are we so divided over this?). Or we can just exchange stories of sailing adventures.


### Single origin
Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
