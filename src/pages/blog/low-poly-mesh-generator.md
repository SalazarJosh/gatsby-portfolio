If it's not obvious, the general theme of my homepage and website is that of a low-poly aesthetic. Long before I started in web I actually spent a lot of time in 3D modeling and game design. The low-poly aesthetic of the homepage is an homage to those times. Though I still dabble with 3D and game design, my main focus has shifted to web. I believe that early experience in 3D design made picking up Three.js a bit easier.

I made this low-poly mesh generator at a time where I was also exploring new forms of generative art. The final product here will not have static color gradients like my homepage, but dynamic color bands with multiple variables that create truly unique results each time to create a mesh.

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.
